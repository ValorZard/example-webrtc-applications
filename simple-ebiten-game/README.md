# Ebitengine Game!

This is a pretty nifty demo on how to use [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) and [pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) to pull off a cross platform game!

You can have a client running on the browser and one running on a desktop and they can talk to each other, provided they share SDPs.

Do ``go run .`` for running the game on desktop

(see [this tutorial for more information on how to build for WebAssembly](https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/webassembly.html))

To play: Just move around with the arrow keys once you have connected!

Right now this only supports two clients
